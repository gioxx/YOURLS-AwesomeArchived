# üß© YOURLS Awesome Plugin Checker

This script analyzes the [YOURLS/awesome](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome) README and checks the status of all listed GitHub repositories. It reports:

- üì¶ Repositories that have been **archived**
- üîÅ Repositories that have been **renamed or moved**

Only repositories in one of those states are shown in the final output.

## üõ† Use It for Your Own Lists

Want to use this script on a custom list of GitHub links?

1. Replace `RAW_README_URL` at the top of the script with a direct raw URL to your Markdown file.
2. Or modify the script to read from a local file instead of downloading.

Example:

```python
RAW_README_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myorg/mylist/main/plugins.md"
```

You can also adapt the regex and filtering logic as needed.
